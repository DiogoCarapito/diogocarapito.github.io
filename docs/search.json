But that would take more time to set up something that might be already solved.\nDuring fast.ai lessons Jeremy talked about fastpages, but seems that the project has been discontinued.\nI found REPL Notes, it had a pretty and simple solution. It seems that the paid version wasn’t functioning right and it was too strict to personalize.\nI ended up with fastpages’ sucessor, quatro.org. It offers enough personalization with clean and minimalistic visuals (thanks bootstrap). It has both code snippets and python visual implementation available. cool :sunglasses:\nThat’s what I appreciate most: eficient implementation that automates tasks that saves time.\nI’m super exited about the upcoming future (with NLP everywhere!). Now that I have finished implementing my blog, I can check another task form my to-do list =)"
