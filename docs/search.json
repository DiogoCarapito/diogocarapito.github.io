    "text": "I’ve been charging into different directions on my journey to build a bridge between health and tech (NLP and LLMs, I’m looking at you). There is so much potential and I have so many ideas!\nSo, lately I’ve been:\n\ngrinding through fast.ai Practical Deep Learning for Coders (just finished the 4th lesson this week)\nexploring website domain name stuff and setting up an website of my previous project (Primary care KPI’s exploration tool, mgfhub.com)\nreconnecting to social media (I’ve been away for a while now), setting up linkedin, twitter and joining relevant discord servers\nafter completing Postgraduate Program in Information Management and Business Intelligence in Healthcare @NOVA IMS, I felt the need to keep learning about data mining, so i’m doing a single course on Predictive Methods of Data Mining\nexploring DL, ML, NLP and LLM main concepts and recent developments (looking at you chatbase.co, ChatPDF and Quarto Help Bot)\ntrying and failing implementing LLMs with jupyter notebooks\nexploring how to start a blog (thanks fast.ai for the push!)\n\nInitially I thought implementing a blog with Dash and publish it on pythonanywhere.com, since I’ve worked with Flask in the past months. But that would take more time to set up something that might be already solved.\nDuring fast.ai lessons Jeremy talked about fastpages, but seems that the project has been discontinued.\nI found REPL Notes, it had a pretty and simple solution. It seems that the paid version wasn’t functioning right and it was too strict for personalization.\nI ended up with fastpages’ sucessor quatro.org. It offers enough personalization with clean and minimalistic visuals (thanks bootstrap). It has both code snippets and python visual implementation available. cool B-)\nThat’s what I appreciate most: eficient implementation and task automation that saves time.\nI’m super exited about the upcoming future (with NLP everywhere!). Now that I have finished implementing my blog, I can check it form my to-do list =)"

Best practices when developing NLP models\nPresented in the opening keynote by Dr. David Gondek, Chief Data Scientist at John Snow Labs, he sumarized some best practices that i found interesting as I’m beginning my NLP journey:\n\nTest your models! - why would you expect untested software to work? Test your models with real data and real use cases and acess it’s performance.\nDon’t reuse academic models in production - published reserach ≠ building reliable systems, testing and fine-tuning are essencial parts of developing a functional tool.\nTest beyond accuracy - Test for Rubustness, Bias, Fairness, Toxicity, Efficiency, Safety. John Snow Labs developed NLP test to help with model testing beyond regular benchmarks."

Prototypical Networks for Interpretable Diagnosis Prediction\nBetty van Aken from DATEXIS Research Group presented about a language model that makes predictions based on parts of the text that are similar to prototypical patients providing justifications that doctors understand. It uses a prototypical network with label-wise attention to find the most similar patients to the input text and then uses a transformer to predict the diagnosis. This is a great example of how NLP can be used in healthcare space and opens the door to a lot of interesting applications.\nCheck their demo and the paper here: This Patient Looks Like That Patient: Prototypical Networks for Interpretable Diagnosis Prediction from Clinical Text"

    "text": "This week has been exiting. I have this NLP project cooking inside my head (for some time now) and I’ve been speeding through many youtube tutorials on both backend and frontend structure.\nFor the backend I’ve been cruising through Pinecone, LangChain and OpenAI API, thanks to tutorials form James Briggs and Data independent. Google colab has been my best friend.\nEven though the backend is the new exiting stuff, I have a sweet spot for the way it’s presented. The frontend must:\nI started with Flask/Dash vs Django, and after some thought, since i have built with it before, I picked Dash. I ended up building a scafold, the development was faster this time arround but it required some hardcode. The result was OK but not stunning. Dash is pretty taxing on layout and design. I deployed it on render (that was a first :smile:)\nLast night I discovered Streamlit. I was captivated by it’s beauty and simplicity and ended up creating a simple scafolding witht he help of Fanilo, Misra Turp and Coding Is Fun tutorials.\nThis morning I stumbled again on Pynecone and I was amazed (thanks to NeuralNine’s video), it seem to a have all I need for my simple implementation. It’s on alpha stage, but I guess I’ll give it a try.\nIf that wasn’t enought, it seems that FastAPI can also serve as a framework for a webapp. This will be fun…\nI’m not sure what framework will I end up with. Let’s keep going!"
