I've been charging into different directions on my journey to build a bridge between **health** and **tech** (NLP and LLMs, I'm looking at you).

So, lately I've been:

- grinding through **fast.ai Practical Deep Learning for Coders** (just finished the 4th lesson this week)
- exploring **website domain name** stuff and setting up an website of my previous project (Primary care KPI's exploration tool, [mgfhub.com](https://www.mgfhub.com))
- reconnecting to **social media** (i've been away for a while now), setting up linkedin, twitter and joining relevant discord servers
- after completing Postgraduate Program in Information Management and Business Intelligence in Healthcare @[NOVA IMS](https://www.novaims.unl.pt/en/education/programs/postgraduate-programs-and-master-degree-programs/postgraduate-program-in-information-management-and-business-intelligence-in-healthcare/), I felt the need to keep learning about data mining, so i'm doing a single course in **Predictive Methods of Data Mining**
- exploring DL, ML, NLP and LLM mian concepts and developments (looking at you [chatbase.co](https://www.chatbase.co/))
- trying using and failing numerous LLM on jupyter notebooks, mainly after a shower (shower "what if..." thought treads)
- exploring how to start a **blog** (thanks fast.ai for the push!)

Initially I thought implementing a blog with **Dash** and publish it on [pythonanywhere.com](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/), since I've worked with Flask in the past months. But that would take more time to set up something that might be already solved.

During fast.ai lessons Jeremy talked about [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages), but seems that the project has been discontinued.

I found [REPL Notes](https://replnotes.com), it had a pretty and simple solution. It seems that the paid version wasn't functioning right and it was too strict to personalize.

I ended up with fastpages' sucessor, [quatro.org](https://quarto.org/). It offers enough personalization with clean and minimalistic visuals (thanks bootstrap). It has both code snippets and python visual implementation available. cool :sunglasses:

That's what I appreciate most: **eficient implementation that automates tasks that saves time**.

I'm super exited about the upcoming future (with NLP everywhere!).
Now that I have finished implementing my blog, I can check another task form my to-do list =)
